# tiger_biosynth
A simple circuit based on CD4093 that sensitive to MOISTURE and organic matter through resistivity of the object.
The circuit react to the resistance and convert it to lights and sounds using the oscillator function of NAND gate in CD4093. 
The sensor is designed as a part of the circuit, located in the tail and leg of the tiger shaped circuit.

Tiger biosynth is developed by Squaresolid (Andreas Siagian), Lifepatch - citizen initiative in art, science and technology
Developed through various circuit from SGMK (Swiss Mechatronic Art Society) and Hackteria.
